        <p>John Melchior Bosco, popularly known as Don Bosco, was an Italian Roman Catholic priest, educator, and writer of the 19th century.
            While working in Turin, where the population suffered many of the ill-effects of industrialization and urbanization, he dedicated his life to the betterment and education of street children, juvenile delinquents and other at-risk youth.
            Don Bosco developed a teaching methods based on love rather than punishment, a method that became known as the Salesian Preventive System. It is based on three pillars: Reason, Religion and Loving Kindness.
            Don Bosco was canonized as a Saint on April 1st 1934 and was given the title of "Father and Teacher of Youth". He is the patron saint of apprentices, editors, publishers, school children, young people, magicians & juvenile delinquents.</p>
